            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>SIR THOMAS VVENT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>WORTHS SPEECH, xxij<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. <hi>Martij,</hi> 1627.</head>
            <p>MAy this dayes reſolution bee as happy, as I conceive the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition (which now moves mee to riſe) is ſeaſonable and neceſſary, for whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we ſhall looke upon the King or the people, it did never more behove this great Phyſitian the Parliament, to effect a true conſent towards the parties then now; This debate carryes with it, a double aſpect, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Soveraigne, towards the Subject, though both innocent, both injured, both to be cured.</p>
            <p>In the repreſentation of injuries, J ſhall crave your attention in the Cures; J ſhall beſeech your equall cares, and better judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:157469:3"/> (ſurely in the greateſt humility, I ſpeake it) theſe illegall wayes are markes and puniſhments of indignation.</p>
            <p>The raiſing of Leavies ſtrengthened by Commiſſion, with unheard of inſtructions, the billetting of Souldiers, by Lieutenants, without leave, have beene, as if they could have perſwaded Chriſtian Princes (nay Worlds) the right of Empire had beene to take away by ſtrong hand; and they have endeavouerd, as farre as was poſſible for them, to doe it.</p>
            <p>This hath not beene done by the King (under the pleaſing ſhade of whoſe Crown I hope wee ſhall ever gather the fruits of Iuſtice) but by Projectors. They have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the prerogative of the King, beyond the juſt Center, which was the ſweet har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the whole.</p>
            <p>They have rent from us, the light of our eyes, enforced a company of Gueſts, worſe then the Ordinaries of <hi>France,</hi> vitiated our wives &amp; daughters before our faces, brought the Crowne to greater want, then ever it was, by anticipating the Revenue, and can the Shepheard be thus ſmitten, and the flocke not ſcattered?</p>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:157469:3"/>
            <p>They have introduced a Privy Counſell ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhing at once the Spheres of all ancient go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, impriſoning us without Baile or Bond. They have taken from us what ſhall I ſay (undeed what have they left us) all meane of ſupplying the King and ingratiating our ſelves with him, taking up the rootes of all proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which if it be not ſeaſonably ſet into the groundby his Majeſties hand, we ſhall have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of beauty baldneſſe.</p>
            <p>To the making of them whole I ſhall apply my ſelfe, and propound a Remedy to all theſe diſeaſes, by one and the ſame thing hath the King and People beene hurt? and by the ſame muſt they be cured, to vindicate what? New things? No. Our ancient, ſober, vitall liberties by reinforcing of the ancient Lawes made by our Anceſtors, by ſetting ſuch a Character upon them, as no licentious Spirit ſhall dare hereafter to enter upon them. And ſhall wee thinke this a way to breake a Parliament? No. Our deſires are modeſt and juſt, I ſpeake truly both for the intereſt of the King and People. If we enjoy not thoſe, it will be impoſſible to relieve him; Therefore let us never feare that they ſhall not bee accepted by his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:157469:4"/>
            <p>Wherefore J ſhall diſcend to my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which conſiſts of foure parts, two of which have relation to the parſons, two to the propriety of goods, for the parſons the freedome of them from impriſoning.</p>
            <p>Secondly, from employments abroad, contrary to the antient Cuſtomes for our goods, that no leavies may be made but in Parliament. Secondly, no billetting of Souldiers: It is moſt neceſſary, that theſe be reſolved, that the Subjects may be ſecured in both.</p>
            <p>Then for the Manner in the ſecond place, it will bee fit to determine it by a Grand Committee.</p>
